# Mortgage Payoff Optimization Calculator

A mortgage amortization and payoff optimization tool designed to show how strategic extra principal payments can reduce both **time to payoff** and **total interest paid**. While traditional calculators provide a static schedule, this project focuses on **optimization**, helping users make informed decisions about accelerated debt payoff.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Amortization Breakdown:** Generates standard monthly amortization schedules.
- **Optimization Mode:** Quantifies savings from additional principal contributions.
- **Interest Savings Analysis:** Shows cumulative interest saved vs. baseline mortgage.
- **Time Reduction Metrics:** Highlights how many months/years of payments can be eliminated.
- **Scenario Comparison:** Easily compare different extra-payment strategies.
- **Financial Education Use Case:** Understand amortization mechanics in a practical way.
